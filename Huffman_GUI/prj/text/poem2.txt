In the quietude of existence,
Where atoms dance and galaxies spin,
I ponder the cosmic riddle—
Why are we, and what lies within?

In the subatomic ballroom,
Particles twirl, entangled and free.
Uncertainty leads the dance,
As quarks and leptons waltz with glee.

The universe unfurls its canvas,
Painting nebulae, stars, and black holes.
Time, a brushstroke across eternity,
Creating stories only the cosmos knows.

From primordial soup to sentient minds,
Life emerges—a grand alchemy.
Cells divide, hearts beat in rhythm,
A symphony of existence, wild and free.

We are stardust, aware and curious,
Blinking into existence on this pale blue dot.
Our thoughts ripple through spacetime,
Echoes of cosmic wonder, never forgot.

Why do quasars blaze? Why do novae burst?
Why does the moon wax and wane?
Existence whispers its secrets,
And we, mere stardust, strain to explain.

Stars die, collapsing into black holes,
Their light extinguished, yet lingering.
We mourn their passing, but also marvel—
For death births new galaxies, shimmering.

Gravity weaves invisible threads,
Binding galaxies, planets, and dreams.
We cling to existence, fragile and fierce,
Navigating the cosmic currents' extremes.

Perhaps existence is an echo,
Reverberating through time's vast halls.
We listen, hearts attuned to the void,
Seeking meaning in existence's enthralling sprawl.
