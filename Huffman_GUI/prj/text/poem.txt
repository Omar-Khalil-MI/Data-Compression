In the vast expanse of the cosmic sea,
Lie questions of life, of you and me.
What purpose we serve, what role we play,
In the grand design, in the light of day.

Are we but stardust, in the endless night,
Seeking meaning, seeking light?
Or are we architects of our own fate,
In a world where love may conquer hate?

The universe whispers in a silent voice,
Life is transient, make your choice.
To live with purpose, to live with grace,
In the cosmic dance, in the endless space.

So ponder deeply, oh thoughtful soul,
In this grand play, what is your role?
For in the end, it's clear to see,
We are but mirrors of eternity.
